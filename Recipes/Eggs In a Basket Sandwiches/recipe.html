                Note that I'm going to be using 3 of what is described here. 
                This recipe describes cooking 1 eggs, but for the recipe I'm doing,
                tripple what is listed here.<br>

                Prepare the other bread by putting salsa and chease on the bread. 
                This will make setting up easier.

            <p class="recipeStepElementText">
                Put bread into pan, then put eggs into the bread.<br>
                If you want them cooked fully, then wait until the back of egg is solid yellow before flipping over,<br>
                otherwise, this requires some practice as I like it runny and do it by feel.<br>

            <img src="St_5 cook until desired.jpg" class="recipeStepElementPicture">
            <p class="recipeStepElementText">
                After flipping, check to make sure the other side is cooked enough.<br>
                It will take some practice. I sometimes poke the center to see if it's good enough.<br>
                I like mine runny, so these are cooked with some liquid yolk in the middle.<br>

            <img src="St_6 Put on other bread.jpg" class="recipeStepElementPicture">
            <p class="recipeStepElementText">
                Finish with putting the egg bread onto the other bread and you are finished.<br>
                This is a good and cheap meal with easy cleanup. It maybe has a 20-30 min cook and clean time.
