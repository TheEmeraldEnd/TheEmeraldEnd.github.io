                This is what the salman should look like after being taken out of the microwave. Don't eat yet, 
                as it's still raw. Saltae both sides with the salt.

                Once airfryer is done preheating, put in salmon and wait.

                Finished salmon will look like this. Note the white coming out of the salmon
                (hopefully you put that tin foil I forgot to picture, but mentioned in text)
                and the flakey bits in the middle. Think 2 phone books with intertwining pages
                being ripped appart. That is what the salmon should feel like. Use a fork to cut a little 
                slice in the middle to test. If it's still squishy like if it's still raw or has a 
                big pink spot, then keep cooking. Check again a few min later and repeat.

                This is the finished salmon. (I add another layer of the seasoning, but that's subjective).
